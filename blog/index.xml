        <description>&lt;p&gt;The good news is that we are on vacation,but it will rain for a long time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the rainy season,I will start my trip. Before that, I think there would be many things that I haven`t prepared. So I will buy some equipments when I go to Decathlon. Departure by the end of month at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- During the summer holiday , we are facing a serious problem —— rainy season. Due to the prolonged fainfall, many crops were waterlogged to death.We have already experience a drought.So you can image how difficulty the farming for the farmer. --&gt;</description>
